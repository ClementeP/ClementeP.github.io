Hello world! I am a computer science PhD student at [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch/), supervised by [Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) and [Michael Hahn](https://www.mhahn.info/). I am interested in a wide range of topics, including formal language theory, controlled generation, and reasoning in LMs. My research aims to develop language models that deliver both stronger correctness guarantees and improved computational efficiency.Before my PhD, I was MSc student in CS at [USI](https://www.usi.ch/it), in Lugano, and before that I was a BSc student in Mathematical Engineering, at Politecnico di Milano in Italy, my home country.


I'm naturally curious and have interests all over the place—from [continental philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phenomenology_of_Spirit) to [greek theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antigone_(Sophocles_play)). Besides finding them genuinely fascinating, I believe that they're both good exercise for critical thinking. Outside of academics, I enjoy skiing, hiking, and rowing, and ran the 1500 meters competitively in high school.
